Data Collection

This study will collect data from X (formerly Twitter) by harvesting tweets related to the #DeleteBoltApp and #DeleteBolt hashtags using a Python-based X scraper. The dataset will also include press releases shared by Bolt on the platform in response to the crisis. A purposive sampling approach will be used to ensure the collected data is relevant to the study's objectives.

To facilitate data collection, a Twitter scraper implemented in Python will be utilized as the primary tool. The hashtags #DeleteBoltApp and #DeleteBolt will be the main keywords to extract tweets related to the protest. Purposive sampling is chosen because it focuses on cases rich in data, aligning with the qualitative research principles outlined by Lambert and Lambert (2012). Prior research by Chen, Duan, and Yang (2021) highlights Twitter as a valuable source of social media data for qualitative analysis.
Justification for Using a Python-Based X Scraper

Using a Python scraper offers several advantages:

    Access to Real-Time, Publicly Available Data – Twitter provides a wealth of real-time data reflecting diverse voices, sentiments, and interactions around the protest.
    Scalability and Efficiency – Python-based tools like Tweepy enable efficient retrieval of tweets based on search parameters, mentions, retweets, and replies, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.
    Automation and Flexibility – Python scripts can automate data collection, filter tweets based on engagement metrics, and store structured data in Excel or other analysis-ready formats (Wisdom & Gupta, 2016).

Precedent for Twitter-Based Research

Harvesting Twitter data has been widely used in communication research. For instance, Jiani (2023) successfully analyzed organizational crisis communication using X data, including corporate responses, public comments, and user interactions. Similarly, Zhang, Hun, and Park (2022) demonstrated how Twitter enables unobtrusive examination of human behavior.
Challenges of Python-Based Web Scraping

Despite its advantages, Python-based scraping presents several challenges:

    Technical and Infrastructure Constraints – Dynamic content, API limitations, and platform design changes can hinder data retrieval (Hughes, Chua, & Hutchings, 2021).
    Rate Limits and Scalability Issues – Twitter imposes API rate limits, restricting the volume of data collected at a given time (Dogucu & Çetinkaya-Rundel, 2021).
    Ethical and Legal Considerations – Data privacy, informed consent, and platform terms of service must be carefully managed (Krotov, Johnson, & Silva, 2020).

Despite these limitations, the study will implement best practices in ethical data collection and utilize API-based scraping methods where possible to ensure compliance with Twitter’s policies.
